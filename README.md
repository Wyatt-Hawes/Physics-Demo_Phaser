Code requirements:
- **Continuous and Discrete Inputs**: The player can move the ball with A and D and has to use the mouse in order to launch the ball.
- **Indirect Goal**: The player must shoot the ball into one of the green areas in order to advance to the next stage
- **3+ physics based scenes**: The title, and stages 1, 2, and 3 are all physics-based gameplay scenes.
- **Other scenes that contextualize gameplay**: Every scene has an introduction scene that introduces the next level.



Asset sources:
- The ball source is the ball asset used in many phaser demos. I removed the background of the image in photoshop before I used it.

- The bouncer in the top right was a screenshot of by computers desktop background that was cropped.

- Note: Some of the debug options are purposefully enabled because I liked the look of the white-outlined boxes and the spring.
